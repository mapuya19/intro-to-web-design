    <h2>
      Iâ€™m a student currently living in New York City. I was born in Pittsburgh,
      Pennsylvania before moving to Little Rock, Arkansas, where I graduated
      from Pulaski Academy in 2019. Currently, I attend New York University
      studying Computer Science and minoring in Game Design. That being said, I
      remain passionate about film and photography.
