          <h1>What are all these words?</h1>
        </div>
        <p>
          There's a bit of lingo you have to learn before becoming a fully
          fledged otaku.
        </p>

        <h3>Otaku</h3>
        <p>
          Someone who is obsessed with any kind of fandom. In Japan, “otaku” is
          a derogatory word that implies that a fanboy is nonfunctional. In
          Western culture, however, the word is defined more specifically as a
          “hardcore fan of anime/manga/Japanese culture.”
        </p>

        <h3>Weeaboo</h3>
        <p>
          An English derogatory term for a non-Japanese person who’s so obsessed
          with Japanese culture that they will emulate it in multiple aspects of
          their lives. No, going out for authentic ramen does not make you a
          weeaboo.
        </p>

        <h3>Tsundere</h3>
        <p>
          A character who starts off cold and indifferent until you get to know
          them, then find their warm and gooey center.
        </p>

        <h3>Shounen / Shoujo</h3>
        <p>
          “Shounen” means “boys” and “shoujo” means “girls.” These terms are
          often used to differentiate between intended audiences. Additional
          terms you might want to familiarize yourself with are
          “bishounen/bishoujo” (or bishie for short) which means a pretty boy or
          pretty girl. There is also “mahoshoujo” which means “magical girl,” a
          common anime genre along the lines of Sailor Moon and Cardcaptor
          Sakura.
        </p>

        <h3>Fan Service</h3>
        <p>
          Additional material that is included to please the viewer, but is not
          necessary to the story.
